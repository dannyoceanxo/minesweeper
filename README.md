# Minesweeper

This was one of the more difficult projects for me.  We were given the logic and backdrop for a game of Minesweeper and were then given the task of making sure the user is given the proper difficulty setting options and having all squares appear accordingly.  I found this assignment especially challenging but appreciated that it gave me a better understanding of API calls.
